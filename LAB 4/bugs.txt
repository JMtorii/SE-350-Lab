==========

1. In certain circumstances, requesting a memory block causes a hard fault.

Cases where the fault seems to occur:

When every block has been used after process 5 is run.

Hypothesis: This error occurs after "release_processor" is called inside a process when
a) no memory blocks are available
b) the immediately following process requires a memory block

xxx
4
5 OOM
1
2
3
4 Breaks

xxx
5 OOM
4 
1
2
3
1
2
3...works

Or using a number coprime with the number of memblocks also works.
